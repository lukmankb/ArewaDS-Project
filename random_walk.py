15-3. Molecular Motion: Modify rw_visual.py by replacing ax.scatter() with 
ax.plot(). To simulate the path of a pollen grain on the surface of a drop of water, pass in the rw.x_values and rw.y_values, and include a linewidth argu-ment. Use 5,000 instead of 50,000 points to keep the plot from being too busy.
15-4. Modified Random Walks: In the RandomWalk class, x_step and y_step are generated from the same set of conditions. The direction is chosen randomly from the list [1, -1] and the distance from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Modify the values in these lists to see what happens to the overall shape of your walks. Try a longer list of choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the âˆ’1 from the x- or y-direction list.
15-5.  Refactoring:  The fill_walk() method is lengthy. Create a new method called get_step() to determine the direction and distance for each step, and then calculate the step. You should end up with two calls to get_step() in fill_walk():
x_step = self.get_step()y_step = self.get_step()
This refactoring should reduce the size of fill_walk() and make the method easier to read and understand.
